                    At TrueFans Connect, we believe in a music industry where artists are fairly compensated for their work, fans can directly support the musicians they love, and venues can thrive by hosting talented performers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Our vision is to create an ecosystem where success spreads organically through community support, powered by our innovative two-tier affiliate system that rewards everyone who helps an artist grow.

                  <p>
                    We're building a world where independent musicians can make a living doing what they love, without sacrificing their artistic integrity or giving away the majority of their earnings to middlemen.

                  <p>
                    TrueFans Connect was born out of frustration with the existing music industry model. Our founders, a mix of musicians, tech entrepreneurs, and music lovers, saw firsthand how difficult it was for talented artists to make a living from their music.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In 2022, after a late-night jam session and conversation about the broken economics of streaming, the idea for TrueFans was sketched on the back of a napkin: a platform where fans could directly support artists, and where that support could spread virally through a community-based affiliate system.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The initial concept was simple: create a platform where 80% of all donations go directly to artists, with 5% distributed to the fans who help spread the word through our two-tier affiliate system, and only 15% going to platform maintenance and growth.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Within months, we had assembled a team of developers, designers, and music industry experts who shared our vision. By early 2023, the first version of TrueFans Connect was launched with a small group of indie artists in Austin, Texas.
                  </p>

            {activeSection === 'growth' && (
              <motion.div
                initial="hidden"
                animate="visible"
                variants={fadeIn}
                className="bg-white rounded-lg p-8 shadow-xl mb-8"

                <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold mb-6 text-primary-600">Growth & Evolution</h2>
                <div className="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
                  <p>
                    The response to our initial launch exceeded all expectations. Artists loved the fair compensation model, fans appreciated the direct connection to musicians they admired, and the affiliate system created a natural incentive for music lovers to spread the word.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Throughout 2023, we expanded our feature set based on user feedback:
                  </p>
                  <ul>
                    <li>Integration with Spotify to help artists showcase their existing catalog</li>
                    <li>Partnership with BandsInTown to display upcoming shows</li>
                    <li>Development of our QR code donation system for live performances</li>
                    <li>Creation of the venue portal to help music venues discover and book rising artists</li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>
                    By the end of 2023, we had grown from our initial test group to over 5,000 artists and 50,000 fans across the United States. Each success story fueled our determination to keep improving the platform.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    In early 2024, we secured our first round of funding from investors who believed in our mission of creating a more equitable music industry. This allowed us to expand our team and accelerate our development roadmap.
